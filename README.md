# ProfitPrediction
Suppose there is a CEO of a
restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new
outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for
profits and populations from the cities.
Our task is to predict the profit according to the population so that we can help him to select which city to expand to next.
In this project , I had used linear regression algorithm without using any library and In this I had used the concept of squared mean error and Gradient descent.
